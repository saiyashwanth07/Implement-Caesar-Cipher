# Implement-Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains an implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique named after Julius Caesar. It encrypts and decrypts text by shifting the characters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.
Features
Encryption: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting letters.
Decryption: Decode ciphertext back to plaintext using the same shift.
Supports uppercase and lowercase letters.
Leaves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation, spaces) unchanged.
Adjustable shift value for customization.
